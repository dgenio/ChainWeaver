"""Offline static analysis for ChainWeaver flows (issues #77, #155).

This module hosts two complementary tools:

* :class:`ChainAnalyzer` (issue #77) discovers which
  :class:`~chainweaver.tools.Tool` objects can legitimately follow each
  other in a flow, purely by inspecting their Pydantic ``input_schema``
  and ``output_schema``.
* :func:`suggest_optimizations` (issue #155) reads a :class:`Flow`
  (optionally paired with recorded
  :class:`~chainweaver.executor.ExecutionResult` traces) and emits
  advisory :class:`Suggestion` objects with stable codes.

Both are pure static passes — no tool is invoked and no LLM is
consulted — the static "what *could* be compiled?" companion to the
deterministic runtime side of ChainWeaver.

The analyzer answers three questions:

1. **Pairwise compatibility** — for each tool, which tools can follow it?
   Exposed via :meth:`ChainAnalyzer.compatibility_matrix`.
2. **Chain enumeration** — what N-step sequences are valid?  Exposed via
   :meth:`ChainAnalyzer.find_chains` with optional ``start``/``end``
   filters and a bounded ``max_depth``.
3. **Flow suggestion** — promote discovered chains to ready-to-register
   :class:`~chainweaver.flow.Flow` objects with auto-wired
   ``input_mapping``.  Exposed via :meth:`ChainAnalyzer.suggest_flows`.

Compatibility rule
------------------

``Tool A → Tool B`` is compatible iff every required field of B's
``input_schema`` appears in A's ``output_schema`` with an equal type
annotation.  Optional fields on B (those with ``is_required() is False``
in Pydantic-speak) are tolerated when missing from A's output; required
ones are not.  The check is intentionally conservative — it never tries
to coerce types or infer subtype relationships.

Invariants
----------

* No LLM, no network, no randomness.  This is a pure-Python static pass.
* Chain enumeration is cycle-free: a tool may appear at most once in a
  single chain.
* Depth-bounded: every public traversal entry point accepts
  ``max_depth`` and uses an explicit DFS budget.

            inputs return an empty list (no suggestions are emitted —
            most families don't apply to topologically-ordered graphs).

            Required for CW002 (parallelizable-pair) and CW003
            (dead-step) which need per-tool I/O schemas.
        traces: Optional list of :class:`ExecutionResult` objects from
            prior runs.  Required for CW004 (cacheable-step).

    Returns:
        A flat list of :class:`Suggestion` objects in family + index
        order.  Empty when the flow looks clean (or when *flow* is a
        DAGFlow).
